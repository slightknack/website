        <strong>This website is currently under development</strong>, so not
        everything's working at 100% quite yet. If you're seeing this page, you
        most likely came across an unimplemented feature.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Here's what we know:</strong>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>{{message}}.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        If this error seems very bad, shoot an email to <code>hello</code> at
        <code>&lt;this domain&gt;</code> dot <code>dev</code>. Be sure to
        include the above error message and what you were doing when it
        happened.

        Have a nice day,

        PS — <strong>Most of the website is probably still functional.</strong>
